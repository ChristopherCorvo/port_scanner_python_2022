### Common network attacks can be divided into four types:
1. fake message attacks


2. exploitable attacks


3. denial of service attacks


4. information gathering attacks
   * Information collection does not cause harm to the target itself,
   and such attacks are used to provide useful information for further intrusions.


   * Information collection technology is a double-edged sword. On one hand, an
   attacker needs to collect information before an attack to carry out an effective attack.


   * On the other hand, a network administrator can use information collection technology
   to discover system vulnerabilities and repair them in advance [2â€“4]. Network administrators usually do not hide their identities during scanning. On the contrary, attackers hide their identities.


   * The most common information collection technology is scanning technology [5,6],
   which includes architecture detection and utilization of information services.

### Computer ports:
* Computer Port == In computer networking, a port is a number assigned to uniquely identify
a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service


* There are 65,536 ports provided by TCP/IP protocol for an IP address in the computer [7].


* Among them, the range of Well Known Ports is from 0 to 1023


* the range of Registered Ports is from 1024 to 49,151, and the range of dynamic
ports is from 49,152 to 65,535.

### ICMP:
* ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
  * is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues


  * mainly used to determine whether or not data is reaching its intended destination in a
  timely manner.


  * The primary purpose of ICMP is for error reporting.
    * When two devices connect over the Internet, the ICMP generates errors to share with the
    sending device in the event that any of the data did not get to its intended destination.
    For example, if a packet of data is too large for a router, the router will drop the
    packet and send an ICMP message back to the original source for the data.


  * The ICMP works with the PING program:
    * ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability
    of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It is available for virtually all
    operating systems that have networking capability, including most embedded network
    administration software.
      * Ping operates by means of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.
      Pinging involves sending an ICMP echo request to the target host and waiting for an
      ICMP echo reply. The program reports errors, packet loss, and a statistical summary
      of the results, typically including the minimum, maximum, the mean round-trip times,
      and standard deviation of the mean.

### Port Scanning:
* The intention is to scan a systems port or ports in order to determine which ports
are open and therefore are vulnerable to attack.

### Vocab:
* request packet
